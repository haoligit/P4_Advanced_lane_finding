# **Project 4 Submission in CarND-Term1**
This repository contains project 4 submission in Self-Driving Car Nano-Degree, Term 1. The main task of this project is detect lane liens on a video stream captured by a front-mounted camera, and estimate the lane curvature and vehicle position relative to the lane center.
##### 1. Advanced_lane_finding_report.md, project writeup
##### 2. P4_code.ipynb, processing pipeline for lane detection on video stream
##### 3. camera_dist_param.p, camera distortion parameters from chessboard calibration
##### 4. camera_warp_param.p, camera perspective transform matrix to (`M`) and from (`invM`) top-down view
##### 5. output_images/, output images at various pipeline steps, and used in the writeup as well
##### 6. project_video_output.mp4, output video stream with back-annotated lane marks, by processing `project_video.mp4`
